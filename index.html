                As the Internet grew over the years, Digital Identity is an even more important part of a lot of people's lifes. As of today, decisions and careers can be decided by how you appear to people online. It's no secret that it's become increasingly more important to know how to control this aspect of one's appearance.

                This association was created around the start of a Master's thesis project : <a href="https://osf.io/zs4xt/">Web Digital Footprints and Data Privacy</a>. The goal of this project was to raise awareness about how private informations are handled online, and the study to appeal to the general Swiss population. The three people involved with this project wanted to make this possible and visible through an independant and non-profit medium : That's how the idea of creating this association came to life.
