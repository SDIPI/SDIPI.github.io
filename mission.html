            <h3>Our mission</h3>
            <p>
                We want to raise awareness about how private data are handled online, what kinds of footprints people leave, and how they can control how they appear to the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                This association was created around the start of a Master's thesis project : <a href="https://osf.io/zs4xt/">Web Digital Footprints and Data Privacy</a>. The goal of this project was to raise awareness about how private informations are handled online, and the study to appeal to the general Swiss population. The three people involved with this project wanted to make this possible and visible through an independant and non-profit medium : That's how the idea of creating this association came to life.
